                    <p>I would like to visit Paris in France, because of its historical sites and because of all the
                        artistic
                        history they have. I would like to see the Mona Lisa and all the other famous paintings by the
                        most
                        prolific painters to ever exist in our life time. And of course i would like to visit the Eiffel
                        Tower.
                        But beside the art and the landmarks i'd like to just go there and enjoy their traditional foods
                        and
                        drinks.</p>

                <h2>Mandarin</h2>
                <p>I would like to learn Mandarin. Not just because it is the second most spoken language in the world,
                    also
                    because
                    i would like to live in China and i would love to intergrate well when i am there. Because unlike a
                    lot
                    of
                    places around the world asia still uses its native language as the cooparate language</p>
